# Unsupervised Learning (CLUSTERING)
## NOTE: Read this first, it will only take about 5-7 minutes.
* This a notebook explaining in simple terms, how to use unsupervised machine learning algorithms, specifically; Flat Clustering (K-Means Clustering) and Hierachical Clustering (Mean-Shift)


## Unsupervised Machine Learning:
* Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which users do not need to supervise the model, all you have to do is give the model unlabeled data containing different features and the model will discover new patterns and information contained in the data 
Let's start with an example
It's your first invasion, you are an alien. You have been waiting for this day all your alien life and it has finally come, you first alien invasion. 
You are invading planet Earth, this planet is inhabited by some primitive life form called humans, you have never seen a human before.
Your alien space ship takes off at 8:00am in the morning from planet Amala, and by 8:02am your space ship is already hovering over earth because, you know space ships travel at light speed (basically they travel really fast). 
Your commanding alien officer tells you, you are going to land in a place called Nigeria. You get excited!!!!!!.
You landed somewhere called Lagos, which happened to be densely populated with humans, so dense it was unhealthy by your alient standards. 
You see your first human, very primitive looking creature. It had short hair, it was producing some kind of deep sound, facial hair, narrow waists and it had broad shoulders. You see many humans like that.
You see another set of humans, these ones have long hair, produced thin sounds, slimmer shoulders, broad waists and little facial hair. You see many like that also.

After spending about 1 week in Lagos, Nigeria, Earth, and seeing about 2 million humans, you came to a conclusion that there were two classes of humans based on their physical appearance/features:
 * Class A: Short hair, Deep voice, A lot of facial hair, Narrow waists and Broad shoulders
 * Class B: Long hair, Thin voice, Small facial hair, Broad waists and Narrow shoulders
 
 
This is simply what unsupervised learning is about, you had never seen humans before until today, but after seeing millions of them you were able to classify humans into two distinct classes above (Class A and Class B). You later learnt that the humans in Class A are called "Male", while humans in Class B are called Female.

The most popular type of Unsupervised Machine Learning is called Clustering.
### Clustering:
  Clustering is an important concept when it comes to unsupervised learning. It mainly deals with finding a structure or pattern in a collection of uncategorized data. Clustering algorithms will process your data and find natural clusters(groups) if they exist in the data. You can also modify how many clusters your algorithms should identify. It allows you to adjust the granularity of these groups.
  
Two most common forms of clustering:
1. Flat Clustering (K-Means Clustering)
2. Hierarchical Clustering (Mean-Shift)

# Check the notebooks in this repository for the explanations and examples of this 2 forms of clustering. This repository also includes a notebook showing the application of hierarchical  clusteing to the common titanic dataset.
