# Unsupervised Learning (CLUSTERING)

* This a notebook explaining in simple terms, how to use unsupervised machine learning algorithms, specifically; Flat Clustering (K-Means Clustering) and Hierachical Clustering (Mean-Shift)


## Unsupervised Machine Learning:
* Let's start with an example
It's your first invasion, you are an alien by the way. You have been waiting for this day all your alien life and it has finally come, you are about to invade planet Earth.
You have read and have been told about humans. But you have never seen one.
Your alien space ship takes off at 8:00am in the morning from planet Amala, and by 8:02am your space ship is already hovering over earth because, you know space ships travel at light speed (basically they travel really fast). 
Your commanding alien officer tells you, you are going to land on a place called Nigeria. You get excited!!!!!!
After landing you see your first human, very primitive looking creature. It had short hair, it was producing some kind of deep sound, facial hair, narrow waists and it had broad shoulders. You see many humans like that.
You see another set of humans, these ones have long hair, produced thin sounds, slimmer shoulders, broad waists and little facial hair. You see many like that also.

After seeing many humans, you came to a conclusion that there were two classes of humans based on their physical appearance/features:
 * Class A: Short hair, Deep voice, A lot of facial hair, narrow waists and broad shoulders
 * Class B: Long hari, Thin Voice, Small facial hair, Broad Waists and narrow shoulders
